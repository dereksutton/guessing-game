This is a simple project that I made to practice my understanding of "while" loops.

When the program runs, it will prompt you to enter a number to guess a randomized number correctly. The prompt continues to loop until you guess the number correctly. With each guess, the dialogue box will specify whether your current guess is too high or too low.

Once you guess the random number correctly, the loop breaks and a special message prints in the console.
